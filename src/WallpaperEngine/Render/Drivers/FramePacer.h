 * budget minus the time since the previous frame woke, truncated to whole
 * milliseconds. The budget resets after fps frames or once overdrawn, so
 * frames average 1/fps but individual frames run a little short or long.
 *
 * Rope-trail history samples on a countdown without carry (1402308a0), so a
 * history interval that is an exact multiple of 1/fps lands on the following
 * frame whenever that frame window sums slightly short of the interval.
